I have included 3 projects with their assets,input code and results in this repositories.
2 of them were the challenge given inthe pdf itself while the posterisation was one of the capstone pjts itself,
1)ball game
  replica of dinosaur game from google.uses a ball instead of dino and rectangle for obstacle
  created the bg image and the sprites using numpy.zeroes and cv.circle() and cv.rectangle() fn
  ball jumps when space bar is clicked
  q for quit and r for reset
2)croping an image
  enables the croping of an image exactly as in an image editor.crops the rectangled region
  utilizes  mouseclick() fn to track mouse movements
  draw a rectangle and that region within the rect will be cropped
3)posterisation
  cartonized an image based on the insrtns provided in the pdf
  utilizes opencv,matplot,numpy libraries
  blurs the image and converts op color level to just 10
  thereby cartoonisation obtained
